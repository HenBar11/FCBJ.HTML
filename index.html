	The stadium is the largest stadium in Israel with a capacity of 34,000.<br></p>
	The club is the <b>most popular</b> in Israel and is one of the Israeli clubs with the <b>highest number of fans in the country</b>. The club was founded in 1936.<br>
	Since the establishment of the club in 1936 until today, Beitar Jerusalem is considered by many to be the "team of the state", the team of the people,<br>
	since Beitar fans spread throughout the entire State of Israel.<br>

<u><b><h3>Former Stadiums-</u></b></h3>
	Beitar held its first games as an professional football team in the “Dajani field”, which was located in the old Katamon neighborhood.<br>
	After the War of Independence and the establishment of the State of Israel,<br>
	the team's home was officially moved to the YMCA Stadium, which has since become the team's regular home ground, until 1991,<br>
	when the team moved to Teddy Stadium.<br>

<br>
<u><b><h3>Teddy Stadium-</u></b></h3>
	In 1991, Beitar has moved to the Teddy Stadium, named after longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek.<br>
	Initially the stadium was two-sided and held 12,000 spectators.<br>
	This was increased to 21,600 when a third side was completed in 1997.<br>
	The fourth side of the stadium was completed in the summer of 2013 in anticipation of the UEFA under 21 championship hosted by Israel,<br>
	increasing the capacity of the stadium to 34,000 seats.<br>
	The ground has been dubbed Gehinom (lit. Hell) by club supporters, for the hostile atmosphere it presents to visiting teams and their fans.<br>
