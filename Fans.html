<p>The "La Familia" fan organization was founded in 2005.<br>
In early 2006, the Beitar Jerusalem team recognized this organization as its official fan organization.<br></p>
<p>As part of its activities, the organization organizes fundraising events, as well as supporting a number of charities and volunteer organizations.<br>
In particular, the organization supported IDF soldiers and residents of the south during military operations in the Gaza Strip.<br>
The organization also organizes happening events for fans during the Passover and summer holidays.<br></p>
<p>This fan organization is known in the media as having an extreme right-wing orientation.<br>
The name "La Familia" was chosen inspired by films about the Italian Mafia.<br>
The name of the fan organization has been linked several times to incidents of violence in sports such as:<br>
attacking fans of other teams, throwing a Molotov cocktail at the offices of the Football Association, and acts of racism.<br>
The members of the organization and the actions attributed to them are controversial among the fans of the team.<br></p>
